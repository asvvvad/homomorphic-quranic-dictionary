The Homomorphic Quranic Dictionary
==

This is a Quranic dictionary based on an automatically generated scaffold from the Unicode Tanzil Uthmani text. You can regenerate the scaffold by running `./scaffold_dictionary.py`, this will generate the file `quranic-dictionary.json` containing the dictionary information.
Words no matter how similar so long as they are not identical, are to be defined as distinct words such that the entire Qur'an can be directly translated without an intimate understanding of the technicalities of the Arabic language. This means that for example, the past and present forms of a verb will be defined independently.
